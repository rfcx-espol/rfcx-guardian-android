        message="Assertions are unreliable. Use `BuildConfig.DEBUG` conditional checks instead."
        category="Correctness"

        summary="Assertions"
        explanation="Assertions are not checked at runtime. There are ways to request that they be used by Dalvik (`adb shell setprop debug.assert 1`), but the property is ignored in many places and can not be relied upon. Instead, perform conditional checking inside `if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) { }` blocks. That constant is a static final boolean which is true in debug builds and false in release builds, and the Java compiler completely removes all code inside the if-body from the app.

For example, you can replace `assert speed > 0` with `if (BuildConfig.DEBUG &amp;&amp; !(speed > 0)) { throw new AssertionError() }`.

(Note: This lint check does not flag assertions purely asserting nullness or non-nullness; these are typically more intended for tools usage than runtime checks.)"

        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly.
